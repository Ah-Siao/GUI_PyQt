# GUI_PyQt
This is a easy to use, non-official GUI interface designed for DLKcat.

With the code, you can do site saturation mutagenesis for the site you want and predict their protein kcat values (with the trained model in the paper).
I wrote the code just for fun with no personal interest. Have fun!
